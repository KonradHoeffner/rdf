First draft of an experimental RDF conversion tool, parameters may change heavily.
Contributions and opinions welcome.

To help users coming from the [Raptor RDF utility](https://github.com/dajobe/raptor) and to minimize bikeshedding,
many of the parameter names, values and descriptions are copied from rapper, but I may differ in others.
As in rapper, the converted file is written to stdout.
Rapper is Copyright (C) David Beckett from the University of Bristol.
Heavy reliance on the [Sophia](https://github.com/pchampin/sophia_rs) library.
